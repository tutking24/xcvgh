# GMD Speed Time: How to Speed Up Your Farming Games with Root Access
 
If you are a fan of farming games, you might have encountered the frustration of waiting for your crops to grow, your animals to produce, or your resources to accumulate. Sometimes, you just want to skip the waiting time and enjoy the game without any delays. Fortunately, there is a way to do that if you have root access on your Android device.
 
GMD Speed Time is an app that allows you to increase the speed of your device's internal clock, which affects the time-based events in many farming games. By speeding up the clock, you can make your crops grow faster, your animals produce more, and your resources multiply. You can also get more gold and coins by completing tasks and achievements in a shorter time.
 
GMD Speed Time is easy to use and compatible with most farming games. You just need to download and install the app from the link below, grant it root permissions, and start the service. You can adjust the speed multiplier from x2 to x1000, depending on how fast you want to go. You can also pause and resume the service at any time.
 
However, there are some drawbacks and risks of using GMD Speed Time. First of all, it may not work on some devices or games, or it may cause crashes or data corruption. Secondly, it may break the EULA of some games and result in bans or penalties. Thirdly, it may affect other apps and functions that rely on the device's clock, such as alarms, notifications, updates, etc. Finally, it may cause your device to slow down or overheat due to the increased CPU load.
 
Therefore, before using GMD Speed Time, you should backup your data and game progress, and use it at your own responsibility and risk. You should also restore the time when you stop the service, but be aware that the time may be inaccurate. You can use a third-party app like ClockSync to sync your device's time with an online server.
 
GMD Speed Time is a useful app for those who want to speed up their farming games and get more rewards in less time. However, it is not a cheat or a hack, and it may have some negative consequences for your device and your game account. Use it wisely and enjoy your farming games!
  
If you want to try GMD Speed Time for yourself, you can download it from the link below. The app is free, but it has some limitations. You can only speed up the time up to x25, and you can only use it for 10 minutes per day. If you want to unlock the full features, you need to buy the pro version for $2.99.
 
The pro version allows you to speed up the time up to x1000, and use it for unlimited time. It also removes the ads and adds some extra options, such as auto start and stop, custom speed profiles, and widget support. You can also support the developer and help him improve the app.
 
GMD Speed Time is a great app for speeding up your farming games and getting more fun and satisfaction from them. However, you should use it with caution and respect the rules and policies of the games you play. Remember that GMD Speed Time is not a cheat or a hack, and it may have some side effects on your device and your game account. Use it wisely and enjoy your farming games!
