A password dialog will appear. Enter your password and click OK. You will see a window with options to boot frozen or thawed. Choose the option that suits your needs and click OK. You will need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
 
When Deep Freeze is enabled, your system configuration will be frozen and any changes made by users or applications will be discarded upon reboot. This means that you do not need to worry about viruses, malware, unwanted programs, user errors, or system degradation. Your system will always be as good as new.
 
When Deep Freeze is disabled, your system configuration will be thawed and any changes made by users or applications will be saved upon reboot.
